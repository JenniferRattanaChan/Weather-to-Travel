# Weather to Travel
Problem Statement: Weather conditions can vary greatly between cities.
This app is meant to help people plan the perfect road trips. The user needs to fill out a simple sign-up authentication(user validation). User can start using the app by entering their starting point and destination, and the Google maps API will map out the best route. Given that information, the weather API will give the user the weather forecast for their route.

*User 2: Mary wants to travel to San Francisco from San Jose, but she has PTSD from the freezing temperatures in SF compared to warm and sunny San Jose.
